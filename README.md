# ezqueue-service

## Introduction
ezqueue-service is a crash-tolerant fifo queue service. It supports the following operations on a queue:
   

  *  Create
  *  Enqueue
  *  Peek
  *  Dequeue

Each queue is uniquely identified by the system by **appname/queuename**  combo.

The service arbitrarily supports a maximum of 1000 queues. This number can be changed by modifying the **MaxQueues** const value in **queue.go**.

Messages are held in a fifo queue in memory, while a write-ahead log stores the Enqueue events in an append-only file. If the queue daemon crashes for any reason, the queues will be restored from head to tail. 

Further durability can be guaranteed by storing the WAL in a separate HA storage system that has a dedicated power supply.

The ezqueued service runs on port 8989. It can either be changed in the main.go or it can be passed an cmd line argument during startup: Ex: ./ezqueued 9090

## Uses
While this application is not tested to be production ready, this is a high-performance fifo queue system that can be used in a CI pipeline in test scenarios where an external queue is required in a microservices environment. It does not require an elaborate setup.

## Interface

The ezqueued can be executed as a daemon or a commandline application. Producers and consumers can commmunicate with the service using gRPC.

## Version info

The system has been tested on 

  * Ubuntu Linux  v21.04
  * golang 1.17
  * protoc3


## Further enhancements in the making
 * TLS support between gRPC client and server
 * Delay and VisibilityTimeout implementation
 * HTTP API interface that can be used to Load Balance the input
 * With a little further effort, this service can be converted to serve as **VERY BASIC** event store. Events can be re-played from any point in the message history.

## To build a docker image 

1. Build the executable file with static lib binding
CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -a -installsuffix cgo -ldflags '-s' -o ezqueueds

2. Run the docker build command
[sudo] docker build -t ezqueueds:1.0.0 .
